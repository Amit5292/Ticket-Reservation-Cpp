# Ticket-Reservation-Cpp
C++ program for a system of movie ticket reservations

Input number of test cases for one of the following types of reservation commands:
add-screen: Adds a screen to the cinema system, with the specified number of rows and columns, along with the seat numbers which are the aisle seats in that theatre/screen. prints success if a new screen has been created, and failure if it already exists.
reserve-seat: Reserves seats in a particular screen, with given row number and seat numbers. prints failure if not possible and success otherwise.
get-unreserved-seats: Prints all the unreserved seat numbers for a particular row at a specified screen.
suggest-contiguous seats: Suggests specified number of contiguous unreserved seats in a particular row, taking into account aisle seats, and one preferred seat number which should be necessarily included. prints 'none' if this is not possible in that row
These commands should be executed in the following fashion:
add-screen name-of-screen number-of-rows number-of-columns space-separated-aisle-seats
reserve-seat name-of-screen row-number space-separated-seats-to-be-reserved
get-unreserved-seats name-of-screen row-number
suggest-contiguous-seats name-of-screen number-of-seats row-number choice-of-seat
